# R Explorations

R Explorations is a blog by Rajesh RS (http://twitter.com/rexplorations / https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeshrs ) on the broad topics of data, statistics and machine learning. It used to be focused on the R language in the past, but the focus of the blog is now more wide ranging.

This repository is a home for the code base built up on the R Explorations blog. This would include R scripts, but in future, may come to include code in Scala and Python too!

Please leave comments at the blog directly.
